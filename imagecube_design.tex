Outline for design section

\begin{itemize}
\item general astropy principles
\item modular design: any steps, in any order (modulo what makes sense)
\item store task history and important parameters in image header
\item maintain constants in config file rather than code
\item command line or modular
\item technical issues: convolution vs resampling vs re-gridding
\end{itemize}
