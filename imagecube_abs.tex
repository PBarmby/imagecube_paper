Astropy is a community Python library for astronomy.
We have developed Imagecube as an Astropy affiliated package for  processing  multiwavelength
(spectro)-imaging.
This  module  automates  tedious  steps  of  image  processing  and
analysis  and  delivers  a  science-ready  image  datacube.
The  included  steps  involve  converting  to  common  flux  units, image  registration
to  a  common  WCS,  and  convolution  to  a  common  resolution.
Individual  steps  can  be  performed separately.
We will show examples of Imagecube in action and provide an update on its current status.
